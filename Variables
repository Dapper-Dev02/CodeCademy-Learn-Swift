// Practicing with String Interpolation
    // Task: Declare a Variable Called "age" and Set It Equal to Your Age.
        var age = 29
    
    // Task: With "age" Set Up, Use "print()" and String Interpolation.
        print("I am \(age) years old.")          RESULT: I am 29 years old.

// Practicing with Constants

    // Task: The mad scientist Kelvin has mastered predicting the weather in his mountain-side meteorology lab. Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website, however, there’s a problem: 
              All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Fahrenheit degrees. Convert a temperature from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C).
          The formula is the following: C=(F−32)/1.8
